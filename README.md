# My Python Notebook

This project contains a Jupyter Python notebook that uses pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling. The project is set up to work with GitHub Codespaces, which provides a complete, configurable development environment in the cloud.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces. This will automatically create a development container with the necessary software, as specified in the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` file.

2. In the development container, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the Python packages that the project depends on by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the project, open the `notebooks/main.ipynb` file in Jupyter. This notebook contains the Python code for the project, along with explanations and visualizations.

You can run the code cells in the notebook by selecting them and clicking the "Run" button. You can also modify the code and add your own cells.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

These packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, and they are automatically installed in the development container when you set up the project.
